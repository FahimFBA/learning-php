I didn't continue learning PHP after this point.  <br>
<u>Reason</u>: I didn't like this language even for a single bit. Also, pressing the `$` sign using a **BLUE** switch based mechanical keyboard repeatedly caused me strain so much that I can't even use my that finger normally. I had to use my left hand's index finger to press the `$` sign. I know it's a very lame reason but I can't help it. As I'm not going to continue learning PHP, I'm not going to continue this repository, and therefore, I'm going to archive it.
